### ASL Gloss Rules

1. General Sentence Structure  
Use the order [Time] + [Location] + [Topic/Subject] + [Comment/Action/Verb] + [Object/Descriptor].
- Example: "Yesterday, I went to the store."
- ASL Gloss: "YESTERDAY STORE ME GO."

2. Omit Articles and Helping Verbs  
Leave out words like "a," "an," "the," "is," "am," "are," etc., as they are not needed in ASL gloss.
- Example: "The dog is barking."
- ASL Gloss: "DOG BARK."

3. Time Indicators  
Place time-related words (like "yesterday," "tomorrow," "every week") at the start of the sentence.
- Example: "Tomorrow, I will call you."
- ASL Gloss: "TOMORROW ME CALL YOU."

4. Location Indicators  
Place location-related words (like "at home," "in the park") after time indicators but before the main topic.
- Example: "In the library, she studies."
- ASL Gloss: "LIBRARY SHE STUDY."

5. Pronoun and Subject Marking  
Always include pronouns (e.g., "me," "you," "he," "she") for clarity, even if they are implied in English.
- Example: "I understand you."
- ASL Gloss: "YOU ME UNDERSTAND."

9. Negations  
To indicate negation, add "NOT" after the verb or action.

For rhetorical questions, use [Rhetorical Question] + [Answer/Comment].
